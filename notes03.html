<h3>Notes - Meiji Kyoto Textile Art and Takashimaya</h3>
<p>
  "items. The subject of this article, however, is a different type the high-quality pieces that were produced in Kyoto for a quarter century the 1880s to the 1910s (that is, the second half of the Meiji period, 1868-1912)."
</p>
<p>
  "From such documentation, including contemporaneous periodicals, newspapers, and exhibition catalogues, as well as secondary sources, we find that duction of art textiles of outstanding workmanship thrived in the second Meiji, with many Kyoto painters contributing to its rise."
</p>
<p>
  "With the outbreak of World War I, the demand for such craft ware declined, and it virtually halted after the war."
</p>
<h4>The Kyoto Silk Industry in the Meiji Transition</h4>
<p>
  "The departure of its traditional noble residents left Kyoto hollowed out at the center." </br>
  Opening of the ports to free trade increased the price of silk which was important for Kyoto. Furthermore the emperor moved to Edo (Tokyo) and with him, many clients.
</p>
<p>
  With the hakurankai, Kyoto became a major and international tourist attraction.
</p>
<p>
  "In 1873, along with the delegation to the Vienna Exposition, the Meiji government sent two Nishijin weavers, Date Yasuke f^ü 3fcgft V (1813-1876) and his assistant Hayakawa Chüshichi fJKJE-fc, to Europe to study Western weaving technology. When they returned a year later, they brought with them nearly thirty new looms."
</p>
<h4>Discovering the Notion of Fine Arts</h4>
<p>
  "A Japanese painter's demonstration of "traditional dessin" at the Exposition attracted favorable attention, and some French critics and collectors expressed admiration for Japanese textiles as fine art specimens. Philippe Burty, for instance, wrote in 1 878 an enthusiastic review of the Japanese display at the Exposition: "The fukusas ... are the most interesting of all. The boldness of the silhouettes, the beauty of the color contrasts are unrivalled in any other people's art. Our friends Edmond de Goncourt and G. de Nittis have collected the finest specimens known in France and have had them framed like masterpieces of paintings."
</p>
<p>
  "Meanwhile, Western reproduction of Japanese pictures designs, a phenomenon that had begun in the 1860s, was already influencing many engaged in the manufacture of decorative art objects and interior tectural designs, and Western appropriation of Japanese designs and motifs tinued apace. The Paris Exposition further spurred the fashion that termed japonisme."
</p>
<h4>Imperial Patronage</h4>
<p>
  "Nishimura embroidery pictures"
</p>
<p>
  "This was the first major occastion whenfabrics produced domestically were used for an imperial architectural interior: previously, fabrics for the interior decoration of Western-style buildings, such as the residence of Prince Arisugawa, had mostly, if no all, been purchased abroad."
</p>
<p>
  "The inclusion of examples of textile art in the regular exhibitions held by these two major art societies, in Tokyo and Kyoto, contributed to the genre's flourishing in the last decade of the nineteenth century. (Japan Fine Arts Society, Kyoto Fine Arts Society)"
</p>
<h4>Iida Shinshichi and the Early Meiji Kyoto Silk Industry</h4>
<p>
  "In November of that year Iida hired a specialist in embroidery, Katõ Tatsunosuke. Unlike weavers or dyers, needleworkers, according to traditional practice, received work not only through commissioners, but also directly from gofuku-ya."
