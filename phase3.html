  Since the individual topics themselves were staring to get too big by themselves, I decided that I would have to present my topics in a different manner. Otherwise it would appear too superficial and I would not be able to show the connections between the topics adequately. So, what I decided on, was to present my topics chronologically. Meaning that I would occasionally switch between Paul Poiret, Haute Couture as well as Japanese Designers in Europe.

    To show that the uncorseted silhouette was not something entirely new at the turn of the century --> refer to the Empire-Stile / Mode à la Grecque, which was popular towards the end of the 18th Century.
  </p>
  <p>
    Followed by the silhouette of the Belle Époque. At the time where Haute Couture made quite some advances, one of them being the founding of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture, des Confectionneurs et des Tailleurs pour Dame in 1868. Two figures who had a big impact on the advances made in that time were Charles Frederick Worth as well as Paul Poiret. Their work not only had a profound impact on Haute Couture, but on the marketing aspect of fashion as well. Whether that be the use of Mannequins, or the hosting of very exclusive costume parties or fashion parades, which would be the forerunner for today’s catwalks.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the turn of the century (from the 19th to the 20th century), there was once again a change in silhouettes. Generally, clothes became less constricting and fewer “shaping devices”, such as corsets or bustles were used. Certainly, the Kimono cannot be accredited for being the one and only contributing factor to evoke this change. I would argue that there were many aspects that gradually led to this change, too many to discuss in this context. However, the appreciation for the Kimono (and Japanese things in general) coincided very well with the loosening of silhouette, as can be seen in creations by Paul Poiret and Madeleine Vionnet.

    Fast forward to the second half of the twentieth century Japan is not out of fashion yet, in the contrary, one could argue that Japan was walking the catwalk in a new, more emancipated wave. After it had been largely interpreted, appropriated, and translated at the turn of the century, in creations by Paul Poiret and the like. This time it was Japanese designers (Rei Kawakubo and Kenzo Takada for example) who moved to Europe and represented themselves and their cultural backgrounds in their creations.
