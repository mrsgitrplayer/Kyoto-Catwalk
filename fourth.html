  During the late 19th Century, the age of Japonism, Japanese kimono and pattern books of kimono design (Hinagata) were brought into the West.
</p>
<p>
  Japanese motifs of cherry blossoms and kabuto (samurai helmets) are arranged vertically. These motifs were hand-worked in elaborate cord embroidery onto separate silk cloths, which was then applied to the cashmere.
</p>
<p>
  In 1887, Pierre Loti published his Madame Chrysanthème, and the image of the chrysanthemum as a symbol of Japan was established.
</p>
<p>
  The textile is woven with metallic thread of pattern like that of overlapping mountains, reminiscent of makie (lacquer) designs. Liberty & Co. was established in 1875 (first called East India House) by Arthur Lasenby Liberty. It sold silk fabric from Japan and China in addition to arts and crafts, and gained a particular reputation for its textiles. Liberty & Co. textiles were used by well-known Paris designers.
</p>
<p>
  In 1907, Paquin created a manteaux japonais that incorporated kimono stitching techniques. Many designs in her creations at that time had an oriental (Japanese or Chinese) image.
</p>
<p>
  Paul Poiret called loose-fitting silhouette coats like this example "kimono coats." The pieces constructing the coat were cut straight. Poiret introduced such coats at the same time as one-piece dresses with a new silhouette having the support point at the shoulders instead of the waist.
</p>
<p>A shawl-style coat cut from a single piece of fabric. From 1910 to around 1913, many fashion houses created coats in a generous swing back style, a design feature of which was an exposed neck, as though influenced by the nukiemon look of Japanese kimono.</p>
<p>A large bow at the back of the belt produces an effect similar to that of a Japanese kimono belt, and red, black, and gold coloring is reminiscent of Japanese lacquerware. In the 1920s, European interest in exotic countries extended to include Russia, Egypt, South America, China, and Japan, and the couturière Lanvin embraced Japanese coloring and motifs in its creations.</p>
<p>The front and back panels are patchworks, constructed from silver and golden patches in a checkered pattern, and their similar design and texture are reminiscent of Japanese lacquerware such as makie.  Madeleine Vionnet was interested in Japanese kimono and fine arts, and in the early 1920s she created many works that seemed to be inspired by them.</p>
<p>From an early stage, Vionnet aimed to liberate bodies, and inspired by the straight form of Japanese kimonos, she started to create dresses focusing on kimonos' structures in the late 1910s. </p>
<p>
  One-piece dress using <i>chirimen</i>, a traditional Japanese silk crêpe, with big <i>oni-shibo</i> wrinkles. Hanae Mori was one of the pioneers who first took Japanese fashion to the international market. Preparing for a 1965 show in New York, she asked herself where Japanese tradition lay, and eventually concluded that it lay in the kimono fabric.
</p>
<p>
  Kenzo Takada, who went to France in 1964, achieved rapid growth as a designer for prêt-à-porter clothing, and in 1970, he started his own brand. A dress by Takada made with simple ordinary kimono fabric was chosen as the cover of Elle magazine, and he became an overnight sensation in the fashion world. Takada's designs had a simple and relaxed style, combined with the esoteric image of Japan, which matched the spirit of the times that followed May 1968.
</p>
<p>
  After studying Haute Couture in Paris, Issey Miyake returned to Japan and tried to make clothing for the people in the world, not for a small number of wealthy people, through the new fashion system "prêt-a-porter." The crossover of rock and tattoos, or the youth culture and the traditional culture for common people, evidently reflected his belief and the spirit of the times.
</p>
<p>
  In the Paris Collections in which he has participated since 1973, Miyake highlighted traditional Japanese materials, which were almost forgotten even in Japan at that time. Miyake tried to revitalize them materializing as a daily wear with functional beauty. Miyake's unique approach, creating clothing based on the technology of Japanese textile industry, was highly appreciated in Japan as well as in Western countries, and it considerably influenced Japanese designers of the next generation.

  This dress is made of double-layered stretch material with an internal pad. It is part of the "Body-Meets Dress, Dress Meets Body" collection, through which the designer intended to unify body lines with the dress. Kawakubo tried to eliminate the stagnant relationship between the human body and the clothes that limited each other's development; that is, the human body restricted the clothes, while the clothes restricted the body. Her efforts resulted in Kawakubo creating designs with a fresh beauty, as seen in this one-piece dress, that had an impact throughout the world.
